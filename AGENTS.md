## Overview

The ERT release-tests project contains several automated agents and services that work together to streamline the OpenShift release process. These systems monitor release streams, trigger tests, aggregate results, send notifications, and support release operations.

## Automated Agents and Services

### 1. Release Detector

**Location:** `oar/controller/detector.py`

**Purpose:** Automatically detects new z-stream releases by comparing the latest z-stream version from ART (OpenShift ART team) with the latest stable version from the release stream.

**How it works:**
- Fetches the latest z-stream version from a GitHub repository file maintained by ART
- Fetches the latest stable version from the OpenShift release stream API
- Compares versions using semantic versioning
- When a new z-stream release is detected, automatically creates a test report to kickoff the QE release flow (see [create-test-report](#1-create-test-report) CLI command)

**Trigger:** Can be run on-demand via CLI command:
```bash
oarctl start-release-detector -r <minor-release>
```

**Key Components:**
- `ReleaseDetector.get_latest_zstream_version()` - Gets latest version from ART
- `ReleaseDetector.get_latest_stable_version()` - Gets latest stable from release stream
- `ReleaseDetector.compare_versions()` - Compares versions
- `ReleaseDetector.start()` - Entry point that orchestrates detection and report creation

---

### 2. Job Controller

**Location:** `prow/job/controller.py`

**Purpose:** Monitors OpenShift release streams for new builds (nightly or stable) and automatically triggers Prow test jobs when new builds are detected.

**How it works:**
- Continuously monitors release streams for new builds across multiple architectures (amd64, arm64, multi, ppc64le, s390x)
- Compares the latest build with the current tracked build
- When a new build is detected:
  - Updates the current build tracking file in GitHub
  - Triggers configured Prow jobs based on the job registry
  - Saves test result tracking files to GitHub
- Supports both nightly builds and stable builds
- Handles upgrade jobs and regular installation jobs

**Trigger:** Can be run as a continuous monitoring service or on-demand:
```bash
jobctl start-controller -r <release> --nightly --arch <architecture>
```

**Key Components:**
- `JobController` - Main controller class
- `JobController.get_latest_build()` - Fetches latest build from release stream
- `JobController.get_current_build()` - Gets currently tracked build from GitHub
- `JobController.trigger_prow_jobs()` - Triggers all configured test jobs for a build

**How it works:**
- Scans GitHub repository for test result files
- For each test result file:
  - Checks if all jobs are completed
  - Fetches detailed test results from GCS artifacts
  - Implements retry logic for failed non-optional jobs
  - Calculates metrics (total, success, failed, pending, required)
  - Determines if build is QE accepted (all required jobs pass)
  - Updates releasepayload with QE acceptance label in OpenShift cluster
  - Marks result files as aggregated when complete
- Deletes result files for recycled/old nightly builds

**Trigger:** Runs as a continuous monitoring service:
```bash
jobctl start-aggregator --arch <architecture>
```

**Key Components:**
- `TestResultAggregator` - Main aggregator class
- `TestResultAggregator.start()` - Main processing loop

### 4. Jira Notificator

**Location:** `oar/notificator/jira_notificator.py`

**Purpose:** Automatically monitors Jira issues in ON_QA status and sends escalating notifications to QA contacts, team leads, and managers when issues remain unverified for extended periods.

**How it works:**
- Queries Jira for OCPBUGS issues in ON_QA status for active z-stream releases
- Tracks when issues transitioned to ON_QA status
- Implements a three-tier escalation process based on weekday hours:
  1. After 24 weekday hours: Notifies QA Contact
  2. After 48 weekday hours: Notifies Team Lead (currently still notifies QA contact)
  3. After 72 weekday hours: Notifies Manager
- If contacts are missing, falls back to notifying assignee and their manager
- Integrates with LDAP to look up manager information
- Only counts weekday hours (Monday-Friday) for time calculations
- Adds Jira comments with @mentions to notify responsible people

**Trigger:** Can be run on-demand or scheduled via cron:
```bash
oarctl jira-notificator [--dry-run] [--from-date YYYY-MM-DD]
```

### Command Workflow

A typical z-stream release workflow using OAR commands:

```
1. create-test-report          # Initialize release tracking
2. take-ownership              # Assign ownership
3. update-bug-list             # First bug sync
   (wait for builds/testing)
4. update-bug-list             # Periodic bug updates (run multiple times)
5. image-consistency-check     # Verify payload images
6. check-greenwave-cvp-tests   # Validate CVP tests
7. check-cve-tracker-bug       # Verify CVE coverage
8. push-to-cdn-staging         # Push to staging
9. stage-testing               # Run stage tests
10. image-signed-check         # Verify signatures
11. drop-bugs                  # Clean up unverified bugs
12. change-advisory-status     # Finalize and approve
```

### ConfigStore

**Location:** `oar/core/configstore.py`

The ConfigStore class manages release-specific configuration:
- Loads encrypted configuration from `config_store.json`
- Stores advisory information, Jira references, Google Sheet URLs
- Provides context for all OAR commands
- Uses JWE encryption for sensitive data (decrypted using `OAR_JWK` environment variable)

### Task Status Tracking

Every OAR command integrates with the Google Sheets test report:
- Task status updated to "In Progress" when execution starts
- Task status updated to "Pass" or "Fail" when execution completes
- If any task fails, "Overall Status" is updated to "Red"
- Provides real-time visibility into release progress

### Integration with Automated Agents

The OAR CLI can be:
- **Executed manually** by release managers and QE engineers
- **Triggered automatically** by the Slack bot (via `tools/slack_message_receiver.py`)
- **Called programmatically** by automated agents (e.g., Release Detector calls `create-test-report`)

## Integration and Workflow

These automated agents work together to provide an end-to-end automated release workflow:

1. **Release Detector** identifies new z-stream releases and creates initial test reports
2. **Job Controller** monitors for new builds and triggers Prow test jobs
3. **Test Result Aggregator** processes test results, retries failures, and accepts builds
4. **Test Result Checker** notifies the team about rejected builds via Slack
5. **Jira Notificator** ensures bugs in ON_QA status are verified in a timely manner
6. **Slack Bot** provides interactive access to OAR commands from Slack

## Deployment Considerations

Most of these agents are designed to run as:
- **Continuous services** (controllers, aggregator, Slack bot) - typically deployed in containers or as systemd services
- **Scheduled jobs** (detectors, checkers, notificators) - typically deployed as cron jobs or Kubernetes CronJobs

### Recommended Deployment:

**Continuous Services:**
- Job Controller (per architecture)
- Test Result Aggregator (per architecture)
- Slack Message Receiver

**Scheduled Jobs:**
- Release Detector (e.g., every 4-6 hours)
- Jira Notificator (e.g., every 2-4 hours)
- Test Result Checker (e.g., every 30 minutes)

## Monitoring and Observability

All agents use Python's standard `logging` module with configurable log levels. Key events to monitor:

- New releases detected
- New builds found
- Test jobs triggered
- Test results aggregated
- Builds accepted/rejected
- Notifications sent
- Errors and exceptions

## Configuration

Most agents rely on:
- **Environment variables** for credentials and API tokens
- **GitHub repository** for persistent state (build tracking, test results)
- **Job registry files** in the repository to define which tests to run
- **OAR configuration** for release-specific settings

See individual agent sections above for specific environment variables required.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Authentication Issues

**Problem:** `JIRA_TOKEN` authentication fails
- **Solution:** Regenerate your Jira personal access token at https://issues.redhat.com
- **Verify:** Test with `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $JIRA_TOKEN" https://issues.redhat.com/rest/api/2/myself`

**Problem:** Kerberos ticket expired for Errata Tool access
- **Solution:** Renew your Kerberos ticket: `kinit $kid@$domain`
- **Verify:** Check ticket status with `klist`

**Problem:** GitHub token permissions insufficient
- **Solution:** Ensure token has `repo` scope for private repositories
- **Verify:** Test with `gh auth status`

#### Agent-Specific Issues

**Release Detector**
- **Problem:** Cannot detect new releases
- **Check:** Verify GitHub repository access and ART's version file location
- **Debug:** Run with `-v` flag for verbose logging: `oarctl start-release-detector -r 4.19 -v`

**Job Controller**
- **Problem:** Prow jobs not triggering
- **Check:** Verify `APITOKEN` for Gangway authentication
- **Check:** Ensure job registry files are properly configured in the repository
- **Debug:** Check GitHub tracking files in `_releases` directory

**Test Result Aggregator**
- **Problem:** Results not being aggregated
- **Check:** Verify `GCS_CRED_FILE` path and credentials
- **Check:** Ensure result files exist in GitHub repository
- **Debug:** Check for errors in aggregator logs regarding GCS access

**Jira Notificator**
- **Problem:** Notifications not sent to Jira
- **Check:** Verify Jira token has permission to comment on issues
- **Check:** Confirm LDAP connectivity for manager lookups
- **Debug:** Use `--dry-run` flag to test without sending actual comments

**Slack Bot**
- **Problem:** Bot not responding to commands
- **Check:** Verify both `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` and `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` are set
- **Check:** Ensure bot is invited to the channel
- **Debug:** Check WebSocket connection logs for Socket Mode

#### OAR CLI Issues

**Problem:** ConfigStore cannot decrypt configuration
- **Solution:** Verify `OAR_JWK` environment variable is set correctly
- **Location:** JWK is stored in Bitwarden: *openshift-qe-trt-env-vars*

**Problem:** Google Sheets API access fails
- **Solution:** Verify Google Service Account credentials are properly configured
- **Check:** Ensure service account has edit permissions on the spreadsheet

**Problem:** Advisory operations fail
- **Solution:** Ensure you have a valid Kerberos ticket: `kinit $kid@$domain`
- **Check:** Test Errata Tool access: visit https://errata.devel.redhat.com

**Problem:** CVE tracker bug check fails
- **Solution:** Verify `elliott` command is available in PATH
- **Check:** Ensure ocp-build-data repository is accessible

#### Background Process Issues

**Problem:** Approval operator background process not running
- **Check:** Look for lock file in `/tmp/oar_scheduler_*.lock`
- **Debug:** Check logs in `/tmp/oar_logs/metadata_checker_*.log`
- **Solution:** Remove stale lock file if process is not actually running

**Problem:** Metadata URL accessibility check times out
- **Expected:** Default timeout is 2 days
- **Solution:** Check if payload metadata URL is actually accessible for the release
- **Debug:** Manually test URL: `curl https://amd64.ocp.releases.ci.openshift.org/api/v1/releasestream/4.19.0-0.nightly/latest`

### Debugging Tips

1. **Enable verbose logging:** Most commands support `-v` or `--debug` flag
2. **Check environment variables:** `env | grep -E '(JIRA|SLACK|GITHUB|OAR)'`
3. **Review recent logs:** Agents use Python logging module with timestamps
4. **Test individual components:** Use dry-run modes where available
5. **Verify external service status:** Check status pages for Jira, GitHub, Slack
6. **Check network connectivity:** Ensure access to internal Red Hat services
