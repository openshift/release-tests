description: Analyze OpenShift CI job failures using AI
---

You are helping the user analyze failures from an OpenShift CI Prow job run.

The user has provided a Prow deck URL (or you should ask for it): {{args}}

Follow these steps:

1. **Parse the URL**: Extract the job name and run ID from the Prow deck URL
   - URL format: `https://qe-private-deck-ci.apps.ci.l2s4.p1.openshiftapps.com/view/gs/{bucket}/logs/{job_name}/{job_run_id}`
   - Example: `https://qe-private-deck-ci.apps.ci.l2s4.p1.openshiftapps.com/view/gs/qe-private-deck/logs/periodic-ci-openshift-openshift-tests-private-release-4.20-automated-release-aws-ipi-f999/1979765746749673472`
   - Extract: bucket (e.g., `qe-private-deck`), job_name, and job_run_id

2. **Fetch test failures and setup must-gather**: Use the Python helper script to fetch JUnit XML files and optionally download/extract must-gather for cluster analysis
   ```bash
   python3 tools/ci_job_failure_fetcher.py <prow_deck_url> --setup-must-gather
   ```
   This will:
   - Output JSON with failure details including test names, error messages, and stack traces
   - Download must-gather.tar if available (from gather-must-gather step)
   - Extract to configured directory (default: `/tmp/must-gather-{job_run_id}/`)
   - Include `must_gather` field in JSON output with extraction status and path

   **Configure omc**: If `must_gather.available` is true in JSON output, run:
   ```bash
   omc use {must_gather.must_gather_dir}
   ```
   Example: `omc use /tmp/must-gather-1983618134094909440`

   **Note**: The `--setup-must-gather` flag is optional. If:
   - must-gather.tar not found: Job may not have gather-must-gather step (skip cluster analysis in step 7)
   - Extraction fails: Check logs and JSON output for error reason
   - Extraction succeeds: Proceed to step 7 for cluster state analysis with omc

3. **Extract Test Metadata** (for later use in Jira searches and code analysis):
   - **Case ID Extraction** (if openshift-tests-private tests detected):
     - Check if test names or stack traces contain `github.com/openshift/openshift-tests-private`
     - Find sequences of digits between dashes in the test name
     - Example: "Author:$uid-LEVEL0-Medium-64296-disable CORS" → case ID is `64296`
     - Look for pattern `-{digits}-` in test name (usually the longest digit sequence is the case ID)
     - Store extracted case IDs for use in steps 4 and 5

   - **Release Branch Extraction** (for code analysis):
     - Extract release version from job name
     - Job name pattern: `periodic-ci-openshift-openshift-tests-private-release-{X.Y}-...`
     - Example: `periodic-ci-openshift-openshift-tests-private-release-4.17-...` → use branch `release-4.17`
     - If no release version found, use `master` branch

4. **AI Analysis**: Analyze the test failures and provide:
   - **Data Handling Note**: The fetcher automatically groups failures by pattern and may truncate data if there are many failures (>50 by default). Check the `truncation_info` and `failure_patterns` fields in the JSON output.
   - **Failure Pattern Analysis**: Use the `failure_patterns` field to identify common root causes. Each pattern shows occurrence count and affected tests.
   - **Failure Categories**: Categorize failures (infrastructure, timeout, assertion, flaky test, etc.)
   - **Priority Assessment**: Identify which failures are most critical based on pattern frequency
   - **Root Cause Hypotheses**: Suggest potential root causes for each failure pattern
   - **Recommended Actions**: Suggest next steps (bug reports, retries, infrastructure fixes, etc.)
   - **Truncation Awareness**: If `is_truncated` is true, acknowledge that only representative samples are shown and mention the total failure count

5. **Query Known Issues from Jira** (Optional - requires Jira MCP):
   - **Checkpoint**: First verify if Jira MCP is available by checking if `mcp__mcp-atlassian__jira_search` tool exists
   - **If Jira MCP is NOT available**: Skip this step gracefully and continue to step 6. Mention in the final report that known issue lookup was skipped (MCP not configured).
   - **If Jira MCP IS available**: Search both OCPBUGS (product bugs) and OCPQE (QE automation issues)

   **A. Search OCPBUGS for Product Bugs**:
   - For each major failure pattern (top 3-5 by occurrence count):
     - Extract 2-3 key terms from error message (e.g., "ImagePullBackOff", "timeout", "authentication failed")
     - Focus on specific component/feature names and unique error keywords
     - Avoid generic terms like "error", "failed", "test", "timeout"
     - Search OCPBUGS using JQL focused on **summary field only** (issue titles):
       ```jql
       project = OCPBUGS AND (summary ~ "keyword1" OR summary ~ "keyword2")
       AND status NOT IN (Closed, Verified)
       ORDER BY updated DESC
       ```
     - **Why summary only**: The `text` field includes descriptions, comments, logs, and stack traces, creating too many false positives
     - Limit to 3-5 most recent/relevant bugs per pattern

   **B. Search OCPQE for QE Automation Issues**:

   - **By Case ID** (use case IDs extracted in step 3):
     ```jql
     project = OCPQE AND (summary ~ "{case_id}" OR description ~ "{case_id}")
     ORDER BY updated DESC
     ```

   - **By Test Name and Error Keywords**:
     - Extract test name (e.g., "OCP-12345") or unique error keywords
     - Focus on test infrastructure terms: "flaky", "intermittent", "race condition", "timeout", "automation"
     ```jql
     project = OCPQE AND (summary ~ "OCP-12345" OR summary ~ "keyword1" OR summary ~ "keyword2")
     ORDER BY updated DESC
     ```

   - **IMPORTANT**:
     - **Include Closed/Done issues** in OCPQE searches (fixes may not be backported to z-stream branches)
     - Limit to 3-5 most relevant issues per search
     - Assess relevance - only include issues that appear related

   **Present Findings**:
   ```markdown
   ### Known Product Bugs (OCPBUGS)
   {if found:}
   - **{BUG_KEY}** ({status}): {summary}
     - Relevance: {brief assessment}
     - Link: {jira_url}
   {if none:}
   - No related OCPBUGS issues found

   ### Known QE Automation Issues (OCPQE)
   {if found by case ID:}
   - **{OCPQE_KEY}** ({status}): {summary}
     - Case ID: {case_id}
     - Relevance: {brief assessment}
     - Link: {jira_url}
     - ⚠️ Note: If Closed/Done, fix may not be backported to this release branch

   {if found by keywords:}
   - **{OCPQE_KEY}** ({status}): {summary}
     - Keywords matched: {list}
     - Relevance: {brief assessment}
     - Link: {jira_url}

   {if none:}
   - No related OCPQE issues found

   **Jira Search Links** (for manual verification):
   - [Search OCPBUGS by keywords]({jira_search_url})
   - [Search OCPQE by case ID]({jira_search_url})
   - [Search OCPQE by keywords]({jira_search_url})
   ```
   - Present with "⚠️ Please manually verify" disclaimer
   - **Only include potentially relevant issues** - do not list clearly unrelated issues (adds noise)

6. **Analyze QE Automation Test Code** (if openshift-tests-private detected):
   - Use case IDs and release branch extracted in step 3
   - **Setup Repository Access**:
     - Check if repo exists: `../openshift-tests-private` (parent directory of current repo)
     - If NOT exists: Clone the repository (user should have access via SSH/HTTPS credentials)
       ```bash
       cd .. && git clone git@github.com:openshift/openshift-tests-private.git
       ```
     - If exists: Update to ensure fresh code
       ```bash
       cd ../openshift-tests-private && git fetch origin
       ```
     - Checkout the correct branch:
       ```bash
       cd ../openshift-tests-private && git checkout {branch_name} && git pull
       ```
   - **Search Test Code**: Use Grep tool to search for the case ID in openshift-tests-private repository
     - Search path: `../openshift-tests-private`
     - Search pattern: `-{case_id}-` to find the test file containing this case
     - If found, use Read tool to get the test source code (focus on the test logic, typically 50-100 lines around the case ID)
     - **Important**: searching in `test/extended/` directory
   - **Analyze Test Code**: For each found test, analyze:
     - Test implementation quality (potential race conditions, hardcoded waits, flaky selectors)
     - Error handling robustness
     - Whether the failure indicates an automation bug vs product bug
     - Common automation anti-patterns: tight timeouts, missing retries, improper assertions
   - **Assessment**: Provide for each test:
     - `is_likely_automation_issue`: true/false/uncertain
     - `confidence`: high/medium/low
     - `reasoning`: why this appears to be automation vs product issue
     - `test_code_location`: file path (relative to repo root)
     - `recommended_action`: fix test code, file product bug, or investigate further
   - **Important**: Only flag as automation issue if there's clear evidence in the code. When uncertain, default to product bug investigation.

7. **Cluster State Analysis with must-gather** (Optional - if must-gather is available):
   - **Check Availability**: Look for `must_gather` field in the JSON output from step 2
   - **If available = false**: Skip this step and note the reason in final report
   - **If available = true**: Use omc commands to analyze cluster state and debug failures

   **Supported omc Commands for Failure Analysis**:
   ```bash
   # View pods in all namespaces (check for CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, etc.)
   omc get pods -A

   # Check specific pod details
   omc get pod <pod-name> -n <namespace> -o yaml
   omc describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>

   # Check pod logs for failed test resources
   omc logs -n <namespace> <pod-name>
   omc logs -n <namespace> <pod-name> --previous  # Previous container logs

   # View events (shows root causes for resource failures)
   omc get events -A
   omc get events -n <namespace>

   # Check node status
   omc get nodes
   omc describe node <node-name>

   # View cluster operators status
   omc get co
   omc describe co <operator-name>

   # Check deployments, replicasets, statefulsets
   omc get deploy -A
   omc get rs -A
   omc get sts -A

   # Check services, routes, endpoints
   omc get svc -A
   omc get route -A
   omc get endpoints -A

   # Check PVCs and storage
   omc get pvc -A
   omc describe pvc <pvc-name> -n <namespace>

   # Check networking diagnostic events
   omc get events -n openshift-network-diagnostics
   ```

   **Analysis Strategy for Failed Tests**:
   1. **Identify test namespace**: Extract from failure details (e.g., test creates resources in specific namespace)
   2. **Check test resources**: Use `omc get pods -n <test-namespace>` to see pod status
   3. **Analyze pod failures**: Use `omc describe pod` and `omc logs` for failed pods
   4. **Check events**: Use `omc get events -n <test-namespace>` to see what happened
   5. **Verify dependencies**: Check if services, configmaps, secrets exist as expected
   6. **Cluster health**: Check nodes, cluster operators for infrastructure issues

   **Example Workflow for Failed Test Analysis**:
   ```bash
   # 1. Find pods related to failed test (e.g., test creates pods with specific labels)
   omc get pods -A | grep <test-identifier>

   # 2. Check pod status and events
   omc describe pod <test-pod> -n <namespace>

   # 3. Get pod logs to see actual error
   omc logs <test-pod> -n <namespace>

   # 4. Check related events
   omc get events -n <namespace> | tail -20

   # 5. If networking issue, check service/endpoints
   omc get svc -n <namespace>
   omc get endpoints -n <namespace>
   ```

   **Include in Report**:
   ```markdown
   ### Cluster State Analysis (must-gather)

   **Must-gather Status**: {available/not available - reason}

   {if available:}
   **Resources Analyzed for Failed Tests**:
   - Test namespace: {namespace}
   - Pods checked: {list of relevant pods and their status}
   - Key findings: {what omc commands revealed}

   **Root Cause Evidence from Cluster**:
   - {Finding 1 from omc - e.g., "Pod test-xyz-123 in CrashLoopBackOff, logs show ImagePullBackOff"}
   - {Finding 2 - e.g., "Events show 'Failed to pull image: unauthorized'"}
   - {Finding 3 - e.g., "Service endpoint missing for test workload"}

   **Correlation with Test Failures**:
   - {How cluster resource state explains the test failure}

   **Recommended Actions**:
   - {Actions based on cluster analysis - e.g., "Fix image pull secret", "Increase resource limits"}
   ```

8. **Generate Summary**: Create a concise summary report with:
   - Overall test results (total, passed, failed, skipped)
   - If truncated, clearly state: "Analyzed X representative failures out of Y total failures across Z unique patterns"
   - Top failure patterns with occurrence counts and affected test examples
   - QE Automation Issues (if any detected with test code analysis)
   - Known issues from OCPBUGS and OCPQE (if Jira MCP was available and matches were found)
   - Critical issues that need immediate attention
   - Links to GCS artifacts and detailed logs

9. **Present Results**: Show the analysis in a well-formatted markdown report
   - Use proper line breaks between sections (add blank lines)
   - Keep output concise and readable
   - Use bullet points instead of tables when possible
   - Ensure each field is on its own line with proper spacing

10. **Cleanup must-gather** (if must-gather was downloaded):
   - After completing the analysis, clean up the must-gather directory to free disk space
   - Use the path from `must_gather.must_gather_dir` field in JSON output
   - Example: `rm -rf /tmp/must-gather-{job_run_id}/`
   - **IMPORTANT**: Always include the cleanup command in your final report so the user can clean up manually if needed

Important notes:
- **Dependencies**: The OAR package must be installed for this command to work
  - If you see import errors, run: `pip3 install -e .` from the repository root
  - This installs the `prow.job.artifacts` module and other required dependencies
- **Required Environment Variable**: `GCS_CRED_FILE` must be set (path to Google Cloud service account credentials file)
  - Check if set with: `echo $GCS_CRED_FILE`
  - The script will fail if this variable is not set
- **Token Limit Management**: The fetcher implements automatic truncation to prevent token limit issues:
  - Individual error messages are limited to 500 characters, stack traces to 2000 characters
  - Failures are grouped by pattern to identify common issues
  - If there are >50 failures (configurable via `MAX_FAILURES_FOR_AI` env var), only representative samples are sent
  - The `failure_patterns` field provides grouped analysis even when truncated
- The helper script uses the existing `prow/job/artifacts.py` infrastructure
- Provide actionable insights, not just raw data
- If you encounter errors, check that dependencies are installed and GCS_CRED_FILE is properly configured
