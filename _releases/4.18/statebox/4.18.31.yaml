    Candidate build 4.18.0-0.nightly-2026-01-08-033320 ACCEPTED with waiver.

    Test Results: 1/126 tests failed (0.8% failure rate)
    Failed Test: OCP-80458 - OLM v1 ClusterCatalog x509 certificate test (AWS IPI)

    Root Cause: Automation timing issue - 90s timeout insufficient for negative test scenario
    Evidence: Test passed on retry #3 (0 failures), failed 2/3 BO3 attempts
    Classification: Flaky test (automation bug), not product regression

    Waiver Justification:
    - Flaky test with timing issue (not consistent failure)
    - All other OLM tests passed (12/13 tests)
    - No infrastructure issues detected
    - Negative test case (error handling, not core functionality)
    - QE automation fix needed: increase timeout from 90s to 180s

    Recommendation: ACCEPT - Build is ready for promotion
    AI Analysis: /ci:analyze-build-test-results provided detailed failure analysis
