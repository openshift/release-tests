  result: 'Candidate build 4.17.0-0.nightly-2025-12-10-204703 analysis: BO3 verification
    failed (1/3 passed) - Attempt 1: Infrastructure failure (DiskPressure), Attempt

    issue). Root cause: Known test automation bug documented in OCPQE-31059 and CM-756.
    Test code missing webhook readiness check before creating Issuer resources. Fix
    tracked in CM-756 (backport PR #23022 to release-4.17). Upstream review confirmed
    no fix merged yet. RECOMMENDATION: WAIVE - This is a test timing/race condition,
    NOT a product bug. Evidence: Attempt 2 passed cleanly, promoted build 4.17.46
    accepted=true proves product is functional.'
