    Candidate build 4.16.0-0.nightly-2025-12-03-200311: Test failure (OCP-55957 SR-IOV operator installation) is WAIVABLE.

    Root Cause: Known test infrastructure issue - SR-IOV operator package missing from QE test catalog (brew + qe-app-registry). Tracked in OCPQE-31219 (In Progress, assigned to [EMAIL_REDACTED]).

    Evidence:
    - Subscription failed with "no operators found in package sriov-network-operator"
    - Catalog sources healthy (READY state), package simply doesn't exist in catalog
    - Failed consistently across AWS and GCP (3/3 attempts) - indicates catalog issue, not product bug
    - Labeled as "qe_level0_automation_issue" in Jira

    Assessment: Test infrastructure issue (HIGH confidence), NOT a product bug. No impact to OpenShift functionality - OLM and subscription mechanism working correctly.

    Recommendation: ACCEPT build. Failure should not block promotion.
issues:
- issue: GitLab stage release pipeline 13833423 failed in 'stage-release-triggers'
    stage with unknown_failure. Downstream pipeline 13833441 also failed. This blocks
    stage-testing from being triggered.
  reported_at: '2025-12-05T07:29:20Z'
  resolved: true
  resolution: Pipeline has been retried. New pipeline 13859640 is now running successfully.
    Downstream pipeline status changed from failed to running at 2025-12-08T11:08:45Z.
