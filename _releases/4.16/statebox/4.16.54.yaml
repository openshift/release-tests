    Candidate build 4.16.0-0.nightly-2025-12-03-200311 analysis completed.

    Test Results Summary:
    - Total jobs: 6
    - Failed jobs: 3 (aws-ipi-f999, gcp-ipi-f999 retried 2x each)
    - Unique failure: 1 test (OCP-55957 - SR-IOV operator installation)

    Root Cause Analysis:
    - Test: [sig-networking] SDN sriov installation LEVEL0-Author:zzhao-High-55957-Sriov operator can be setup
    - Issue: SR-IOV operator package missing from QE test catalog (brew + qe-app-registry)
    - Jira: OCPQE-31219 (In Progress) - exact match found
    - Classification: Test infrastructure issue, NOT a product bug

    Decision: ACCEPT build
    - This is a known test automation issue tracked in OCPQE-31219
    - The failure is consistent across all retries (not flaky)
    - No product functionality is impacted
    - Build can proceed to next phase

    Recommendation: Build accepted for promotion to release candidate.
