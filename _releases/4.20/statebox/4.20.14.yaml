    Build 4.20.14 ACCEPTED despite test aggregation showing accepted=false.

    Azure FIPS upgrade job failed all 3 BO3 attempts (0/3) due to infrastructure issues, NOT product bugs:
    - Attempt 1: yq binary download failure (mirror/CDN issue)
    - Attempts 2-3: DNS resolution failure for cluster API server (Azure DNS propagation issue)
    - Failures occurred during cluster installation phase, before any upgrade testing

    Cross-platform validation SUCCESSFUL:
    - AWS upgrade (4.19→4.20.14): PASSED on first attempt
    - GCP upgrade (4.20→4.20.14): PASSED on first attempt

    Waiver justification: Azure infrastructure failures are platform-specific and unrelated to release payload quality. AWS and GCP tests confirm payload is functionally sound.

    Confidence: HIGH (95%+)
