    - Azure FIPS: Passed first attempt  \n- GCP: Failed attempts 1-2, passed attempt\

    \ on different attempts)\n- Test 79770 (OLM v1 metrics): Missing retry logic for\
    \ metrics availability\n- Test 27649 (Compliance operator): Insufficient timeout\
    \ for scan completion\n- Both failures GCP-specific, indicating platform infrastructure\
    \ timing differences\n\nClassification: WAIVABLE FAILURES\n- No product bugs detected\n\
    - Test automation issues (missing retries/timeouts)\n- Eventual consistency confirmed\
