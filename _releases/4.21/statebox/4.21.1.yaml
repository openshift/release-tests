    WAIVABLE FAILURES - All test failures are GCP CI infrastructure issues, NOT product bugs.

    Candidate build 4.21.0-0.nightly-2026-02-04-232248: accepted=false (1/6 jobs failed BO3)

    Failed Job: GCP upgrade test (4.20→4.21) - 0/3 attempts succeeded
    - Attempt 1: GCP IAM policy limit exceeded (1,501 > 1,500) - cluster installation failed
    - Attempts 2-3: ClusterVersion override blocked upgrade - test automation bug (override not removed before upgrade)

    All other platforms passed:
    - AWS IPI: Passed
    - Azure IPI FIPS: Passed (2/3 BO3, flaky UI test)
    - GCP IPI: Passed
    - AWS Disruptive: Passed
    - AWS Upgrade (4.21→4.21): Passed

    Assessment: RECOMMEND ACCEPT
    - Zero product bugs detected
    - GCP failures are infrastructure/test-automation issues
    - Promoted build (4.21.1) passed ALL tests (accepted=true) confirming product quality
    - Confidence: HIGH

    Actions Required:
    1. File OCPQE issue: GCP upgrade test workflow must remove ClusterVersion overrides before upgrade
    2. Escalate GCP IAM cleanup to CI infrastructure team

  status: Pass
  started_at: '2026-02-09T15:56:16Z'

  result: All blocking tests passed BO3 verification. Promoted build 4.21.1 is accepted
    (accepted=true). Retriggered GCP jobs succeeded after initial IAM policy limit
    failures.
